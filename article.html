  <h1>Article on HTML</h1>
  <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

  <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:<br><br>

    <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.<br><br>
    <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br><br>
    <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.<br><br>
    <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>

    <p>HTML is a written markup language used to annotate text, images and other content in a structured manner for display on the internet.</p>

        <p>HTML is used to provide structure to a webpage and make it accessible to users of the internet through text, visual formatting and search factors. It is commonly known as the most basic building block of the web, working alongside CSS and JavaScript to create the websites we see while browsing.</p>
        
        <p>HTML, particularly its most recent form, is a highly capable programming language with a variety of uses when it comes to web browsing and data. Not only do we use HTML for web page development, web document creation and internet navigation, HTML5 introduces advanced APIs, facilitates client-side storage via localStorage and IndexDB, offers data entry support, facilitates offline application use through caching and can even be used in game development.</p>
